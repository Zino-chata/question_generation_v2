The Basics,How long does EQ Bank hold my funds for?,"<p>Generally, we hold funds deposited by cheque or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for five business days, beginning after the date of deposit. This means that funds held will actually become available by the sixth business day, when you include the date of deposit. </p>
<p>For example, if you make a deposit on a Monday, you can access the funds on the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although the deposit is reflected immediately in your account balance, you won’t be able to withdraw or transfer your funds until the hold period has passed. However, during the hold period, you still earn interest on the deposit amount. For more details, check out our <a href=""/general-banking/legal/hold-funds-policy"">Hold Funds Policy</a>.</p>"
