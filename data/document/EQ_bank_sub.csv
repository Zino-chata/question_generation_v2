The Basics,Are my deposits with EQ Bank covered by CDIC?,"<p>Yes—deposits made under EQ Bank and Equitable Bank are aggregately eligible for CDIC protection up to $100,000, per insured category, per depositor, as outlined in CDIC’s ""<a href=""https://www.cdic.ca/your-coverage/protecting-your-deposit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Protecting Your Deposits</a>"". For example, you’re covered for up to $100,000 combined across your individual Savings Plus Account, EQ Bank GICs, and any deposits in your name that you have with Equitable Bank. Eligible deposits in your joint account are insured separately.</p>
<p>EQ Bank is a trademark of Equitable Bank. Equitable Bank is a member of the CDIC. </p>"
The Basics,How long does EQ Bank hold my funds for?,"<p>Generally, we hold funds deposited by cheque or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for five business days, beginning after the date of deposit. This means that funds held will actually become available by the sixth business day, when you include the date of deposit. </p>
<p>For example, if you make a deposit on a Monday, you can access the funds on the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although the deposit is reflected immediately in your account balance, you won’t be able to withdraw or transfer your funds until the hold period has passed. However, during the hold period, you still earn interest on the deposit amount. For more details, check out our <a href=""/general-banking/legal/hold-funds-policy"">Hold Funds Policy</a>.</p>"
