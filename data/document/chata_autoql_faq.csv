<p>Business users across every role and department benefit from an intuitive and reliable solution that allows them to access their data, whenever they need it.</p>"
Do you offer a free trial or a Proof of Concept?,"<p>Every database is unique and we build a custom language model for each customer we work with. This allows us to provide robust coverage for querying enterprise-grade databases, but this also means we’re not able to offer free trials of AutoQL, since there’s no “out of the box” version.</p>
<p>We do, however, offer a no-cost, no-commitment Proof of Concept. <a href=""https://chata.ai/contact/"">Get in touch with our team</a> to learn more about how this works and how to get started.</p>"
Are there any specific architecture requirements that must be met for implementation to be possible?,"<p>AutoQL is an extremely flexible API-first solution that can be customized for any software that uses a relational database. It works exceptionally well with cloud-native software solutions that have a web-based interface.</p>
<p>Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) that perform continuous deployments can readily take advantage of our end-to-end system that includes flexible front end widgets. Each widget takes just 2-3 hours on average to implement.</p>
<p>We can also integrate with on-premise software systems.</p>"
What should I expect once we get started?,"<p>Getting started with AutoQL can be broken out into four key stages: connect, train, implement, and go live.</p>
<p>Stage 1 – Connect:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">We’ll work with you and your team to configure an encrypted, read-only connection between our cloud and your database. Without storing your data, this connection allows us to train a custom model, execute queries, and pass data back to you. We use thorough <a title="""" href=""https://chata.readme.io/docs/autoql-security-best-practices"" target="""" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">security practices</a> to make sure none of your users’ data ends up where it shouldn’t. You’ll be able to configure access and permissions for individual customers and users later on.</p>
<p>Stage 2 – Train:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Next, we get to work generating training data and building a custom language model specific to your database. We begin with unsupervised machine training based on our system’s current understanding of typical database structures, allowing us to tailor our model to your app and deliver a feature that your users can operate intuitively. Semi-automated training is also available if you wish to customize certain queries to fit terms or jargon that are unique to your business.</p>
<p>Stage 3 – Implement:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Once your custom language model is ready, it’ll be your turn to build and implement a conversational UI in your solution, letting your users query their data from anywhere in your application. At this stage, you can make use of any of our flexible implementation options (all widget components are open source) or opt to build directly on top of our API.</p>
<p>Stage 4 – Go Live:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">With AutoQL trained on your database and implemented in your interface, you’re ready to start offering conversational access to data on demand to users! As users ask questions, their conversational English will be sent up to our cloud and translated into a query language appropriate for your database. Relevant data is then returned to them in easy-to-understand visualizations, all within seconds.</p>"
What is an 'end-to-end' system for delivering access to data on demand?,"<p>We’ve built a suite of proprietary conversational AI technologies that enable the real-time translation of natural language (the words you’re accustomed to using in everyday life) to database query languages. This is the core functionality and value of the AutoQL API.</p>
<p>But the AutoQL system is comprised of several critical stages and elements that come together to elevate human-to-database interactions.</p>

What does ''dynamically translating natural language to SQL'' mean?,"<p>When it comes to accessing information from a business’ relational database, team members are typically required to write and run database query language statements (DBQL) like SQL. But this is a time-consuming task that requires the expertise of technically-savvy and database-literate team members.</p>
<p>With AutoQL, any user can simply ask questions in their own words to access and analyze their data.</p>
<p>Through our API, AutoQL receives, understands, and interprets natural language queries, dynamically generates a corresponding database query language statement, executes the DBQL statement against the database through a read-only connection, and returns relevant data to the end user within seconds.</p>"
How does AutoQL answer questions about my unique database from my unique users?,"<p>Each AutoQL integration begins with our team generating custom training data and building a custom language model unique to your database. We handle all the heavy-lifting here, and thanks to the technologies we’ve developed, these processes happen rapidly and with high-precision.</p>
<p>Once we’ve built a training corpus and trained a custom model for your database, AutoQL can be implemented in your solution, allowing your users to ask questions about their data in natural language and instantly receive answers.</p>"
How do I know what queries I can ask?,"<p>The core value of AutoQL is accessing data easily and intuitively using natural language, or more simply, the words you use every day.</p>
<p>Think about the way you would ask a coworker a data-related question, like: “What was our click-through rate on our newsletter last month?” or “Which sales rep brought in the most new business this quarter?”. Approach querying with AutoQL the same way! Simply type questions in your own words and you’ll receive data responses in just seconds.</p>
<p>Tip: Be clear and succinct. Remember, if your question wouldn’t make sense to another person, you might be missing important context that AutoQL will need in order to answer your question accurately. For example, if you went up to a coworker and said “Expenses”, they’d probably say, “Well, what about expenses?”. But if you went up to that coworker and asked, “What were our total expenses last month compared to this month last year?”, they’d be much more equipped to provide an answer to you.</p>"
Can the SQL statement that is generated through a user query join multiple tables in a database?,"<p>Yes, AutoQL automatically generates table-joining SQL when a user query requires it.</p>
<p>The system is built to dynamically translate natural language into accurate SQL statements that can include multi-table joins, back joins, and alias joins.</p>"
Is it possible to query across different data sources?,"<p>At this time, users can only query one data source. AutoQL can be integrated with a data warehouse or a data lake that brings data from multiple sources together.</p>"
"How does AutoQL handle similar column, table, or item labels in the database?","<p>A key feature of AutoQL’s technology is the ability to disambiguate unique labels. This means the system is trained to determine what a user is referring to, even when that meaning is not explicit.</p>
<p>For example, “invoice” might refer mean different things for users in the accounting department vs. users in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Unique labels are taken into account during the integration and training processes, and we’ve built in a machine learning model that is trained to disambiguate value labels based on the context of the question being asked.</p>"
Do queries ever fail to return data? What happens if a query doesn’t work?,"<p>There are cases where a natural language query may be asked and AutoQL will not immediately return a data response. There’s a handful of reasons why this may occur, but even when a data response cannot be returned immediately, AutoQL will always return a message that provides information about why the query could not be answered, or a prompt to help the user clarify what they are asking.</p>
<p>Here’s a summary of common circumstances that can inhibit a data response from being returned:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>User Permissions Lacking:</em> If a user attempts to query information that they do not have access to in the database, they will receive an error message indicating that their query could not be executed due to a permissions issue.</li>
<li><em>Confidence Threshold Issue: </em>AutoQL is designed to ensure that only correct data responses are returned in response to user queries. Therefore, AutoQL will not return data if the system is not confident that an optimal SQL statement has been generated.</li>
<li><em>Ambiguous Input or User Error: </em>When a natural language query is received but is not immediately understood by the system, AutoQL has built-in models that act as “safety nets” or “check points”. In such cases, these models kick in to try to determine exactly what data the user is asking for. If this verification step is unsuccessful (whether that be because the meaning of the user’s query is still unclear, or because the data the user wants is not actually present in the database), AutoQL will not return a data response.</li>

How does pricing work?,"<p>We offer two pricing models: Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription-Based pricing. In both cases, AutoQL pricing is consumption-based (per API call) and works on a sliding scale.</p>"
What are the benefits of offering a consumption-based pricing model?,"<p>We’ve carefully built out our pricing models to optimize benefits for our customers and for the partners we work with.</p>
<p>Here’s some of the core benefits of a consumption-based pricing model:</p>
<ul>
<li data-leveltext=""o"" data-font=""Courier New"" data-listid=""2"" aria-setsize=""-1"" data-aria-posinset=""1"" data-aria-level=""1"">Allows for full transparency and no surprises.</li>
<li data-leveltext=""o"" data-font=""Courier New"" data-listid=""2"" aria-setsize=""-1"" data-aria-posinset=""2"" data-aria-level=""1"">No POC fees and no implementation fees derisks the go-to-market process for our Integrators. Billing is only initiated when AutoQL is implemented and being used.</li>
<li data-leveltext=""o"" data-font=""Courier New"" data-listid=""2"" aria-setsize=""-1"" data-aria-posinset=""3"" data-aria-level=""1""><span data-contrast=""auto"">Integrators retain control of how they roll out AutoQL – whether that be gradually to a beta group of users, OR to all users in a dedicated new release. </span></li>
</ul>"

<p>The only data we store is the minimum data required for AutoQL to run securely and efficiently in your software application. We refer to this as nominal data, or the unique data we identify in your database that your users will ask questions about. This allows us to ensure that queries run quickly and return the results that users are expecting.</p>
<p>For example, a user might ask “How many of each item did Jane Doe buy last month?” In the context of this query, we only store the information that the customer “Jane Doe” exists in that user’s database so an optimal database query can be generated and executed dynamically.</p>
<p>We also store user queries (the questions your users ask in natural language), and we expose this to Integrators in the Integrator Portal. This allows us to provide a direct line of visibility into what users are asking; a feature that offers Integrators critical insight into what their users care about and how they’re using the system.</p>"
How and when is data encrypted?,"<p><span data-contrast=""auto"">Data is encrypted at rest and in flight and we use non-numeric IDs to ensure that data is secure at every level. We use JWT to secure who has access to our system, and for how long.</span><span data-ccp-props=""{}""> </span></p>

What is the Integrator Portal?,"<p>As developers ourselves, we know it can be frustrating to do one-off tasks in all the APIs we use, so we wanted to simplify these kinds of processes when it came to our own API.</p>
<p>The AutoQL Integrator Portal is a web app designed to help you implement and successfully manage your AutoQL deployment. It contains tools for developers, data for product managers, and serves as a helpful and easy-to-navigate interface that enables you to facilitate many functionalities of the API.</p>"
What can I do in the Integrator Portal?,"<p>The Integrator Portal has a variety of uses including:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><em>1. Simplifying setup</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Initial setup is facilitated through a simple step-by-step process, enabling you to quickly and easily connect databases to AutoQL through the Integrator Portal.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><em>2. Streamlining one-off tasks</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Configuration can be done through the simplified GUI in the Portal. Since configuration only has to be done once, you can simply set it and forget it.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><em>3. Accessing data and product insights</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Use the Portal as a lens to see what your end users are asking and gain a better understanding of your users’ motivations and needs. In the Portal, you have total visibility into common query trends, allowing you to highlight points of friction and see what data is in highest demand.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><em>4. Developer assistance</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Access API Keys, history logs, and all sorts of things that help developers gain important insights and get important work done, faster.</p>"
