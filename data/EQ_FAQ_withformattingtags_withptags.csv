The Basics,Are my deposits with EQ Bank covered by CDIC?,"<p>Yes—deposits made under EQ Bank and Equitable Bank are aggregately eligible for CDIC protection up to $100,000, per insured category, per depositor, as outlined in CDIC’s ""<a href=""https://www.cdic.ca/your-coverage/protecting-your-deposit/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Protecting Your Deposits</a>"". For example, you’re covered for up to $100,000 combined across your individual Savings Plus Account, EQ Bank GICs, and any deposits in your name that you have with Equitable Bank. Eligible deposits in your joint account are insured separately.</p>
<p>EQ Bank is a trademark of Equitable Bank. Equitable Bank is a member of the CDIC. </p>"
The Basics,How long does EQ Bank hold my funds for?,"<p>Generally, we hold funds deposited by cheque or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for five business days, beginning after the date of deposit. This means that funds held will actually become available by the sixth business day, when you include the date of deposit. </p>
<p>For example, if you make a deposit on a Monday, you can access the funds on the following Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although the deposit is reflected immediately in your account balance, you won’t be able to withdraw or transfer your funds until the hold period has passed. However, during the hold period, you still earn interest on the deposit amount. For more details, check out our <a href=""/general-banking/legal/hold-funds-policy"">Hold Funds Policy</a>.</p>"

<p>You’re responsible for tracking your contribution amounts each year. Keep your eyes on your TFSAs across all institutions, so you don’t accidentally over-contribute!</p>"
TFSAs,Are TFSA contributions tax-deductible?,"<p>Contributions to a TFSA are not deductible for income tax purposes. </p>
<p>Any amount contributed as well as any income earned in the account (for example, interest earned in an EQ Bank TFSA Savings Account or TFSA GIC) is generally tax-free, even when it is withdrawn.</p>"
TFSAs,"If I don’t contribute to a TFSA, can I use my unused contribution room in the future?","<p>If you withdraw from your TFSA, you don’t lose your contribution room. You can recontribute amounts you’ve withdrawn on or after January 1 of the following year or years, and your contribution room carries forward indefinitely.</p>"
TFSAs,Do I need to have a particular income level to take advantage of a TFSA?,"<p>TFSAs are accessible to anyone, so long as they meet the eligibility requirements—but there are no minimum or maximum income levels. Every eligible person accumulates contribution room annually, starting from 2009.</p>"
TFSAs,"If I didn’t open a TFSA in 2009, do I still accumulate contribution room?","<p>Assuming you were at least 18 years old in 2009, yes. As of 2020, for example, the TFSA cumulative limit (if you've never contributed) is $69,500. This number grows every year, subject to the annual TFSA contribution limit set by the federal government.</p>"
TFSAs,What happens if I contribute more than my contribution amount to a TFSA?,"<p>If you exceed your TFSA contribution limit for the year, the Canada Revenue Agency will charge a tax on the excess at 1% per month. The tax is calculated based on the highest excess amount for the month and, unlike RSPs, there’s no $2,000 grace amount.</p>
<p>You’re responsible for tracking your contribution amounts each year. Keep your eyes on your TFSAs across all institutions, so you don’t accidentally over-contribute!</p>"
TFSAs,Do I have to pay tax when I withdraw from my TFSA?,"<p>Thank the government for putting the TF in TFSA. So in other words, no. Withdrawals are completely tax-free, and your contribution limits reset every January 1.</p>"
TFSAs,Can I transfer my EQ Bank TFSA to another financial institution?,"<p>You should be able to move your money without penalties. </p>
<p>Should you wish to close your EQ Bank TFSA, please call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK).</p>"

RSPs,What’s the difference between an RSP and an RRSP?,"<p>RSP is an acronym for Retirement Savings Plan. It can refer to any number of financial products designed to help you save for retirement. </p>
<p>An RRSP, which stands for Registered Retirement Savings Plan, is a type of RSP with specific tax advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contributions can be deducted from your income</li>
    <li>Earnings on savings held within an RRSP aren’t taxed until you withdraw funds </li>
</ul>
<p>While an RSP can refer to many types of accounts, an RRSP refers to one type of account specifically. </p>
<p>An RRSP is probably the best known RSP, which is why you’ll sometimes hear the terms used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Your EQ Bank RSP becomes registered once you add money to your account—which means you get the tax advantages of an RRSP.</p>"
RSPs,What are the benefits of an RSP?,"<p>Any money you contribute to an RSP is tax-deductible, meaning the amount you contribute can be deducted from your income, which means you pay less in income taxes. In addition, the income you earn within your RSP is tax-free. </p>
<p>You will have to pay income taxes when you withdraw from your RSP.</p>
<p>Typically, you’ll withdraw funds from an RSP in retirement, when you’ll likely be in a lower tax bracket, as opposed to withdrawing during your peak earning years.</p>"
RSPs,What types of RSPs does EQ Bank offer?,"<p>The EQ Bank RSP offers two types of investment products: RSP Savings Account and RSP GIC. </p>
<p>When you open and deposit funds into an RSP Savings Account, you can then choose to buy an RSP GIC. Once your RSP GIC reaches maturity, your principal and earned interest will be deposited back into your RSP Savings Account.</p>"

    <li>The maximum annual contribution limit for the taxation year MINUS any company-sponsored pension plan contributions (defined as PA, or short for “pension adjustment” on your T4 slip.

Any greater than $2,000, though, and the CRA will impose a tax of 1% per month. </p>
<p>You’re responsible for tracking your contribution amounts each year, across all financial institutions in which you hold an RSP.</p>"
RSPs,Who can contribute to an EQ Bank RSP?,"<p>Anyone who has earned income, has a Social Insurance Number (SIN), has attained the age of majority in their province, and has filed a tax return can contribute to an EQ Bank RSP up until December 31 of the year they turn 71.</p>
<p>Once you turn 71, your EQ Bank RSP proceeds can either be:</p>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
    <li>Withdrawn from the Plan</li>
    <li>Transferred to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) with another institution.  </li>
</ol>"
RSPs,How do I withdraw from my RSP?,"<p>RSPs are intended to provide a source of income in retirement, so you’re penalized with significant withholding taxes by the Canada Revenue Agency, if you withdraw the funds before you retire. </p>
<p>While the money you contribute to the RSP is technically yours, your bank will take between 10% and 31% in withholding tax right off the top and turn it over to the government—the more you withdraw, the higher the percentage. Once that money is withdrawn, you’ve permanently lost that contribution room in your account.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions—such as the Home Buyers Plan (HBP) and Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP)—which allow you to borrow a certain amount from your RSP tax-free to help pay for your first home or cost of full-time post-secondary education. In these cases, you essentially borrow money from yourself and you have to pay back the sum within a set amount of time.</p>
<p>Should you wish to withdraw funds from your EQ Bank RSP for any reason, please call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK). EQ Bank will deposit your RSP funds into your individual or joint Savings Plus Account only.</p>"
RSPs,How does the Home Buyers Plan work?,"<p>The Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) is a program that allows you to withdraw funds from your RSP to buy or build a qualifying home for yourself or for a related person with a disability. The HBP allows you to pay back the withdrawn funds within a 15-year period.</p>
<p>Should you wish to withdraw funds from your EQ Bank RSP under the Home Buyers’ Plan, please call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK).</p>"
RSPs,How does the Lifelong Learning Plan work?,"<p>The Lifelong Learning Plan (LLP) is a program that allows you to withdraw up to $10,000 in a calendar year from your RSP to finance full-time training or education for you, your spouse, or common-law partner. </p>
<p>As long as you meet the LLP conditions every year, you can withdraw from your RSP until January of the fourth calendar year, after the year you made your first LLP withdrawal. You cannot withdraw more than $20,000 in total.</p>
<p>Should you wish to withdraw funds from your EQ Bank RSP under the Lifelong Learning Plan, please call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK).</p>"
RSPs,When does an RSP mature?,"<p>An RSP must mature by the end of the year in which the annuitant turns 71 years of age.</p>
<p>For an EQ Bank RSP Plan, we will contact customers in January of the year they turn 71 to confirm what they wish to do with the proceeds. Options are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Withdraw from the plan, </li>
    <li>Transfer to a <a href=""https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-retirement-income-fund-rrif.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Registered Retirement Income Fund</a> (RRIF) with an issuing institution </li>
</ul>"
RSPs,What is a beneficiary?,"<p>A beneficiary is someone who gets your stuff (in this case, your money) when you die. When you open an RSP, you can designate one or more beneficiaries who will receive the proceeds upon your death. </p>
<p>The benefit of naming a beneficiary is that they won’t need to pay tax on the value of the RSP after you pass away.</p>
<p>Naming a beneficiary has other benefits as well, such as adding clarity around who receives the financial proceeds, so you can avoid any confusion (after all, you won’t be around to clear things up). </p>
It also reduces the amount of time before the beneficiary can access the funds, and gives you control over who receives the money, and what percentage of your account should be allocated to them."
RSPs,How do I designate a beneficiary on my EQ Bank RSP or TFSA?,"<p>You can designate up to five beneficiaries, and choose the percentage that should be allocated to them upon your death. </p>
<p>In the event the percentage entitlement(s) for your beneficiaries do not add up to 100%, the remaining portion will be paid to your estate.</p>
To designate a beneficiary, you’ll need to sign in to your EQ Bank account and download the beneficiary designation form."
RSPs,What information do I need to designate a beneficiary?,"<p>To designate a beneficiary, you’ll need to sign in and download the beneficiary designation form for your EQ Bank RSP. </p>
<p>You’ll need to <a href=""/contact-us"">mail or fax</a> it back to EQ Bank with the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Legal first and last name</li>
    <li>Date of birth</li>
    <li>Social Insurance Number (SIN)</li>
    <li>Mailing address</li>
    <li>Relationship to the account holder</li>
</ul>"
RSPs,What happens when my EQ Bank RSP GIC reaches maturity?,"<p>Once your RSP GIC reaches the maturity date, the funds and interest earned will be deposited in your RSP Savings Account. </p>
<p>You’ll receive an email or SMS alert notifying you of the RSP GIC maturity. You can use the funds to purchase another RSP GIC or keep the money in your RSP Savings Account.</p>"
RSPs,How will I receive my tax slips for my EQ Bank RSP?,"<p>Tax slips, such as the RSP Contribution Receipt or T4RSP, can be downloaded as PDFs by signing in to your account through the EQ Bank mobile app or web browser. </p>
<p>You can find the dates of when these documents will be available for download <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">here</span>.</p>
<p>Actual or deemed withdrawals from an RSP will be reported on a T4RSP slip. You won’t be issued a T4RSP slip, unless you’ve made withdrawals from your EQ Bank RSP.</p>
<p>EQ Bank will issue two contribution receipts, which will allow you to claim the appropriate deductions to your taxable income:  </p>
<ol>
    <li>Your 2020 contribution receipt, which states the contributions made in the last 10 months of 2020</li>
    <li>Your 2021 contribution receipt, which states the contributions made for the first 60 days of 2021</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always access the archive of your past tax documents by signing in to your EQ Bank account. New documents will be added as they become available.</p>"
RSPs,Is there a fee to transfer my EQ Bank RSP to another financial institution?,"<p>No, we believe you should be able to move your money without penalties. </p>
<p>Should you wish to close your EQ Bank RSP, please call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK).</p>"
RSPs,How much can I deposit into an RSP Savings Account?,"<p>An EQ Bank RSP can hold up to $1 million, combining your RSP Savings Account and your RSP GICs. Be sure to keep track of your contribution limit. </p>

RSPs,How many RSP accounts can I hold?,<p>You can hold one EQ Bank RSP account. </p>

<p>You can easily change the frequency or cancel your recurring transfers from your desktop or mobile app.</p>"
Joint Accounts,What is a joint account?,"<p>A joint account is a bank account in the name of two or more people. When you open a joint account with EQ Bank, you and your account co-holder(s) share all the same great features and benefits of our individual Savings Plus Account.

<p>Some things to think about:</p>

    <li>An account co-holder can withdraw all funds from the joint account without your permission</li>

Joint Accounts,How do I open a joint account?,"<p>If you already have an EQ Bank account, adding a joint account takes minutes.

<p>To open a new joint account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sign in to online banking using a web browser</li>
    <li>Click “Products” at the top of your screen</li>
    <li>Under “Savings Plus Account,” click “Open account,” and select the joint option</li>

    <li>Invite up to three co-holders
    <ul>
        <li>If a co-holder is an existing EQ Bank customer, use the email address associated with their EQ Bank account</li>
        <li>Once your invitation is sent, your co-holder(s) will need to accept the invitation before the joint account process is complete</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Review your invitation details and click “Submit”</li>
</ul>

Joint Accounts,Can I share a joint account with someone who’s not a Canadian resident?,<p>Unfortunately not. All joint account holders must be Canadian residents (excluding Quebec).</p>
Joint Accounts,Does a co-holder need to be an existing EQ Bank customer?,"<p>You can invite anyone you want—roommates, best friends, romantic partners, even your mom and dad—as long as they’re a Canadian resident (excluding Quebec) and have reached the age of majority in their province.</p>
<p>
If you invite someone who is not an EQ Bank customer, they’ll need to sign up in order to accept your invitation. The good news is the invite explains the simple three-step process to become a joint account co-holder.</p>
<p>Or they can open an account by visiting <a href=""/index"">www.eqbank.ca</a> and <a href=""https://join.eqbank.ca"">applying online</a>. Either way, to accept your invite, they must sign up with the email address you provided in your invitation.</p>"
Joint Accounts,How do I know if a co-holder has accepted my invitation?,"<p>To check the status of an invitation, sign in to your EQ Bank account, and select the account from which you sent the invite. From the ""Account co-holders"" section, you can view the status of your invitations.</p>
<p>
An “Active” status means the co-holder has successfully accepted your invitation. A “Pending” status means the co-holder has not yet accepted your invitation. A “Failed” status means the co-holder has failed to answer the security question correctly. If you want to continue the joint account process with this co-holder, you’ll need to resend your invitation.</p>"
Joint Accounts,What if a co-holder hasn’t received my invitation?,"<p>First, check to see you have the correct email address. Sign in to your EQ Bank account and select the joint account from which you sent the invite. You can resend an invitation from the “Account co-holders” section.</p>"
Joint Accounts,What if my co-holder’s invitation expires?,"<p>Your co-holder’s invitation is valid for a period of two weeks.</p>
<p>
If the invitation has expired, simply sign in to your EQ Bank account and select the joint account from which you sent the invite. You can resend an invitation from the “Account co-holders” section.</p>"
Joint Accounts,Can I have multiple joint accounts with different people?,"<p>Absolutely! In addition to your main account, you can open up to four other accounts, for a total of five accounts. These can be all individual, all joint, or a mixture of both.</p>"
Joint Accounts,Can I convert my individual account into a joint account?,"<p>You can, but keep in mind that once you convert your individual account into a joint account, it can’t be converted back. We recommend keeping your own individual savings account and opening a net new joint account.</p>"
Joint Accounts,Who claims the interest earned on their income taxes for a joint account?,<p>A T5 tax slip will be issued in the name of the primary account holder and generated no later than February 28 of every year. All account co-holders can get a copy of the T5 tax slip.</p>
Joint Accounts,Is there an account balance limit on a joint account?,"<p>Great question! As an individual customer with a joint account, you can have a maximum balance of up to $500,000 sum total across all your accounts.</p>"
Joint Accounts,How does CDIC deposit insurance work for joint accounts?,"<p>Eligible joint deposits are protected for up to $100,000 per set of co-holders, not per co-holder. Eligible joint deposits are insured separately from individual Savings Plus Account deposits.</p>
<p>
So, for example, you would be provided coverage for up to $100,000 in each of the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your individual savings account</li>
    <li>Your joint savings account with a spouse</li>
    <li>Your joint savings account with your parents</li>

Joint Accounts,Can I change the primary account holder?,<p>The person who initiates the joint account is referred to as the primary account holder. We don’t currently offer the option to change the primary account holder.</p>
Joint Accounts,Are joint account alerts different from my individual account alerts?,"<p>If you’re the primary account holder of a joint account, there are no differences. However, if you’re not the primary account holder of a joint account, the following differences currently apply to alerts for your joint account:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All settings, including dollar values of alerts, are preset and cannot be adjusted at this time</li>
    <li>Alerts are sent via email only and may take up to two days after a transaction is complete</li>
    <li>Alerts will not be sent for unsuccessful recurring transactions</li>
</ul>"
Joint Accounts,"I’m not the primary account holder, so why do my joint account alerts behave differently?","<p>This is a snag that our team is working hard to resolve. Rest assured these differences are temporary, and we‘re working to provide real-time adjustable alerts via your preferred platform (text message or email).</p>"
Joint Accounts,How do I know if I’m the primary account holder of my joint account?,"<p>Sign in to your EQ Bank account and go to your joint account details page. From the “Account co-holders” section, you’ll see a “Primary” label beside the primary account holder’s name.</p>"
Joint Accounts,How do I claim interest earned on my joint account?,"<p>According to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), you must report your share of interest from a joint account based on how much you contributed to it.</p>
<p>A T5 tax slip will be issued to the primary account holder of the joint account and will be made available as a downloadable PDF by no later than February 28 of each year.</p>
<p>Please note that in the case of individual Savings Plus Accounts converted to joint accounts, interest credited at the end of the month of conversion will be included in the personal tax slip issued to the single account holder.  </p>
<p>Interest credited subsequent to the month of conversion will be included in the joint account tax slip issued to the primary account holder.</p>

International money transfers,How long will it take for the international money transfer to be accessible to the recipient?,"<p>The exact time period of an international money transfer depends on multiple factors, including the destination country, the time of day the transfer is sent, and security checks.

International money transfers,Can I send an international money transfer if I don’t know my recipient’s bank details?,"<p>You will not be able to send an international money transfer without the recipient’s bank details. In order to send the transfer, you’ll need to add a new recipient and fill in the banking details in the mandatory fields. </p>"
International money transfers,What should I do if I entered my recipient's details incorrectly?,"<p>Typos or mistakes in recipient details are one of the main reasons for requesting a transfer cancellation, but once a transfer is submitted, it’s not possible to cancel it. To prevent this from happening, please look over all the recipient information on the “Review Details” screen before clicking “Submit”! </p>
<p>If you do realize you’ve entered in something incorrectly, you can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get in touch with our EQ Bank Customer Care team</li>
    <li>Wait for the money to bounce back</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve entered in the wrong amount, the payment will not bounce back. In this case, get in touch with the recipient so they can tell their bank to reject the payment or return the money to you.</p>
<p>If you’ve entered in the wrong account number and the transfer is sent to the wrong account, neither EQ Bank nor TransferWise has the ability to get involved in disputes between senders and recipients, so it’s important to check the account information on the “Review Details” screen before clicking “Submit.”</p>"
International money transfers,Are there maximum amount limits for sending an international money transfer?,"<p>Yes, there are maximum amounts, as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>$9,500 CAD for a single transaction for all currencies, except CNY ($5,800 maximum), PKR ($8,400 maximum) and BDT ($7,767 maximum)</li>
    <li>$9,500 CAD for a 24-hour period</li>
</ul>"
GICs,How many GICs can I buy?,"<p>You can buy up to 20 GICs. Each GIC purchase must be for at least $100, and can be up to a maximum of $100,000. Customers can hold up to $500,000 in GICs, excluding interest earned.</p>"
GICs,What happens when my GIC matures?,"<p>Once your GIC reaches the maturity date, the funds will be placed in your Savings Plus Account (the one from which your initial investment was funded). You will receive an email or SMS alert notifying you of the GIC maturity.</p>"
GICs,What happens to my GICs if I die?,"<p>Should an account holder pass away, next of kin should call the EQ Bank Customer Care team at 1-844-437-2265 (844-4EQ-BANK). If possible, please have the date of death, and lawyer or trustee details available, and we’ll do everything we can to help.</p>"
GICs,How do I cancel my GIC?,"<p>You have up to the end of the next business day following the day you purchased your GIC (your GIC Effective Date) to cancel your GIC online. Once the cancellation period has passed, your GIC is non-redeemable and your funds are locked in. For more information, please refer to the <a href=""/general-banking/legal/gic-agreement"">EQ Bank GIC Agreement</a>.</p>"
GICs,Can I redeem GICs before they mature?,"<p>Unfortunately not. Once the cancellation period has passed, your GIC is non-redeemable, and your funds are locked in. For more information, please refer to the <a href=""/general-banking/legal/gic-agreement"">EQ Bank GIC Agreement</a>.</p>"
GICs,Is the interest earned from my GIC taxed?,"<p>Yes. Any interest you earn from your GIC investments will be included on your T5 tax slip.</p>
<p>T5 tax slips can be found by signing in to your account through the EQ Bank mobile app or online banking website.</p>"
